Test project created with sample mockup 

#### Modifying wpnrq theme

1.  Go to wp-content/themes/wpnrq/gulp and install gulp plugins with command
    ```sh
    $ npm install
    ```
2. Edit sass/js files in wp-content/themes/wpnrq/gulp/src and run
    ```sh
    $ gulp build
    ```
    This will clear the files in wp-content/themes/wpnrq/assets and create new minified css and js files
    
3. Now clear the browser cache to see the theme css/js changes
